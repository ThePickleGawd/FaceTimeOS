# FaceTimeOS: Mac-use AI Voice Agents

Control your entire Mac with AI voice Agents, via:

1. **FaceTime**: Text your Mac asking to start a FaceTime, it start a session and share screen. Then, talk naturally to instruct any computer-related task.
2. **iMessage**: Text any other prompt, it will fulfill your task

## Overview

Our project is organized into three folders

1. `Agent-S` ‚Äî Our fork of the current SoTA computer-use agent framework. [Original Repo](https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S)
2. `backend` - Flask server to handle iMessage/FaceTime and generate voice transcriptions and replies
3. `frontend` ‚Äî UI to prompt and view current actions of Agent S

## Quick Start

All you need is a single LLM key. Export `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or swap in the key for your preferred provider) and you‚Äôre ready.

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThePickleGawd/FaceTimeOS.git
cd FaceTimeOS

# Setup Agent-S (see original repo for more details/debugging)
cd Agent-S
uv sync

cd ..

# Setup backend
cd backend
uv sync

cd ..

# Setup UI
cd frontend
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --ignore-scripts
npm rebuild sharp
```

For more details on Agent S: https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S

**2. Provide your API key**

```bash
# Put this in ~/.zshrc or export it manually
# Grok is recommended and is currently working with no issues
export GROK_API_KEY="xai-your-grok-key"

# There are some issues with OpenAI (it worked at one point though!)
export OPEN_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
```

See the `run_*.sh` files in Agent-S for an idea of what providers we support and how to add your own.

```bash
# Optional: To enable TTS and STT
export FISH_API_KEY="key"
```

**3. Give Agent Permission to Control Keyboard/Mouse**

When you launch for the first time (see final step), you will be prompted to give permissions to `Terminal` or `VS Code`, etc. This is required for the Agent to control your computer.

**4. Route FaceTime audio input/output (optional)**

To route audio directly from FaceTime to our AI Agent, install a lightweight MacOS app. This is optional if you want to use iMessage only.

![FaceTime Audio Setup](/docs/facetime-audio.png)

- Install BlackHole App (Install _both_ 2 and 16 channel version. No config is needed): https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole
- Restart computer
- In FaceTime menu, `Video->Microphone` set to BlackHole 2ch. And `Video->Output` set to BlackHole 16ch

**5. Launch FaceTimeOS**

In the base directory:

```bash
# Run everything (UI, backend, Agent S). Change as needed for correct LLM provider
./run.sh
```

Note: The UI Grounding endpoint is no longer live. However, this is not needed unless you want the absolute best clicking accuracy. To set this up yourself, visit: https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS/blob/main/README_deploy.md

## Why FaceTimeOS?

#### 1. Seamless Remote Control

Why download clunky remote desktop apps when you can simply **FaceTime your Mac**?  
FaceTimeOS lets you call or message your computer directly through **native Apple interfaces** ‚Äî no extra setup, no third-party tools, just the simplicity of FaceTime and iMessage.

#### 2. Human-Level Intelligence

Powered by our extended **Agent S3** framework, FaceTimeOS achieves **state-of-the-art (OSWorld-verified)** performance on common computer-use tasks ‚Äî surpassing existing systems like OpenAI or Anthropic‚Äôs Computer-Use Agents.  
We bring **human-level computer interaction** to everyone, accessible from anywhere in the world.
