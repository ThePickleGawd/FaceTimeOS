# Cluely

[Cluely](https://cluely.com) - The invisible desktop assistant that provides real-time insights, answers, and support during meetings, interviews, presentations, and professional conversations.

## Sponsored by Recall AI - API for desktop recording
If you‚Äôre looking for a hosted desktop recording API, consider checking out [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/product/desktop-recording-sdk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=prat011-free-cluely), an API that records Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, in-person meetings, and more.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS) installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer
- A REST backend that handles chat/agent commands (the bundled proxy forwards to `http://localhost:5000` by default)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd free-cluely
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# If you encounter Sharp/Python build errors, use this:
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --ignore-scripts
npm rebuild sharp

# Or for normal installation:
npm install
```

### Running the App

#### Method 1: Development Mode (Recommended for first run)
1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This command automatically:
- Starts the Vite dev server on port 5180
- Waits for the server to be ready
- Launches the Electron app

#### Method 2: Production Build
```bash
npm run dist
```
The built app will be in the `release` folder.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Closing the App**: 
   - Press `Cmd + Q` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Q` (Windows/Linux) to quit
   - Or use Activity Monitor/Task Manager to close `Interview Coder`
   - The X button currently doesn't work (known issue)

2. **If the app doesn't start**:
   - Make sure no other app is using port 5180
   - Try killing existing processes:
     ```bash
     # Find processes using port 5180
     lsof -i :5180
     # Kill them (replace [PID] with the process ID)
     kill [PID]
     ```
   - Ensure your REST backend is reachable (defaults to `http://localhost:5000`)

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle window visibility
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + H`: Take screenshot
   - 'Cmd/Enter': Get solution
   - `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys`: Move window

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Windows Issues Fixed 
- **UI not loading**: Port mismatch resolved
- **Electron crashes**: Improved error handling  
- **Build failures**: Production config updated
- **Window focus problems**: Platform-specific fixes applied

### Ubuntu/Linux Issues Fixed 
- **Window interaction**: Fixed focusable settings
- **Installation confusion**: Clear setup instructions
- **Missing dependencies**: All requirements documented

### Common Solutions

#### Sharp/Python Build Errors
If you see `gyp ERR! find Python` or Sharp build errors:
```bash
# Solution 1: Use prebuilt binaries
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install --ignore-scripts
npm rebuild sharp

# Solution 2: Or install Python (if you prefer building from source)
brew install python3  # macOS
# Then run: npm install
```

#### General Installation Issues
If you see other errors:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder
2. Delete `package-lock.json` 
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Try running with `npm start`

### Platform-Specific Notes
